# CBYXMeetupProgram
This file is just an overall guide on how to use the program.


Usage:
  Step 1:
    Extract the .zip archive
  Step 2:
    Go to the dist file, and run the .exe there
  Step 3:
    A prompt will appear in a console window. It will have instructions, although they will be explained
    in more detail here. The input should begin with an apostrophe and end with an apostrophe. Inside the
    apostrophes, you will write the names of the people you want to meetup with, including yourself in the 
    following format: 'First1 Last1_First2 Last2_First3 Last3' and so on, where "First" is first name, "Last"
    is last name, they must be capitalized, and the number is just to distinguish for them in the example. 
    As a more concrete example, here would be the format for me, Adam, and Delenn: 
                                                                     'Zeke Bennett_Adam Bonnett_Delenn Main'. 
  Step 4:
    Reading the output should be straightforward, but I will explain anyways. It will be displayed as:
    ('CityName', ('X_Coordinate','Y_Coordinate)). This is just the name of the suggested city, and the
    coordinates are the geographic coordinates of that city.


Adding people:
  Step 1:
    Open the 'build' folder
  Step 2:
    Click on 'CBYX_Placements.csv'
  Step 3:
    Add a new line and type the person's name, and 4 'None's separated by commas, followed by the city name.
    (If you're confused by this, there are plenty of examples in the file)


Bug Reporting:
    I feel as if it is inevitable that there will be some issues for this program, so I have set up a 
    gmail account specifically for reporting these. This email is: cbyx.meetup.bugreport@gmail.com. 
    Please include the entire console output, as well as any other files you may have modified in 
    any way if you happened to have done so.

Good luck, and have fun meeting up! All praise be to Jeanne Paul!
